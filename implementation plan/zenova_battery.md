# Stable Battery Percentage Design

## Overview

Smartphones do not calculate battery percentage from instantaneous voltage alone. They combine charge-flow measurement, voltage checks, filtering, and user-interface rules so the percentage does not jump whenever a load starts, stops, or charging begins.

For the **ZENOVA 12 V 30 Ah parallel battery bank**, retain the calibrated voltage sensor as a live-voltage reference and safety backup. Once INA228 monitoring is integrated, use INA228 current, power, and energy measurements as the **primary source** for stable SoC estimation.

Voltage-only SoC remains approximate because terminal voltage changes with load, charging, temperature, age, and internal resistance.

## Why Voltage Changes

Terminal voltage follows the relation:

```
V_terminal = V_OCV - (I × R_internal)
```

| Term       | Meaning                                                         |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| V_terminal | Live voltage measured by the ESP32 or multimeter                |
| V_OCV      | Rested/open-circuit voltage, more closely related to stored charge |
| I          | Current entering or leaving the battery                         |
| R_internal | Battery internal resistance                                     |

- When an inverter or appliance turns on, current rises and voltage temporarily drops — this is **voltage sag**.
- When the load stops, terminal voltage **rebounds**.
- During charging, terminal voltage rises above its rested value.

Therefore, directly mapping every live voltage sample to a percentage creates **unstable SoC readings**. Rested-voltage methods are most useful when the battery has little/no current flow and enough time to relax.

## Measurement Hierarchy

| Priority | Source                    | Main purpose                                                        |
|----------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1        | INA228 output monitor     | Measure current/power/energy leaving the battery                    |
| 2        | INA228 input monitor      | Measure current/power/energy entering the battery                   |
| 3        | Voltage sensor GPIO 34    | Live terminal voltage, low-voltage checks, connection detection, backup/reference |
| 4        | DS18B20 battery sensor    | Temperature safety and SoC confidence context                       |
| 5        | Rested voltage            | Occasional correction of SoC after stable low-current conditions    |

Use voltage for immediate voltage monitoring and safety logic, but **do not** let short voltage sag/recovery immediately change the displayed battery percentage.

## SoC and DoD Definitions

|-------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|

| DoD               | —                           | Percentage of capacity already used                           |

**Do not** redefine 20% SoC as 0%. Show the actual SoC and separately identify whether the DoD safety limit has been reached.

|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| ESP32 board             | ESP32-WROOM-32                                             |
| Analog input            | GPIO 34 / ADC1                                             |
| Sensor                  | 0–25 V analog voltage-divider module                       |

| Existing tested multiplier | ~4.96                                                  |

### Circuit note

Place a **0.1 µF capacitor** between the voltage-sensor output and common ground near GPIO 34 to reduce high-frequency noise.

- Do **not** connect battery voltage directly to GPIO 34.
- Use `analogReadMilliVolts()` and appropriate attenuation — ESP32 ADC calibration is attenuation-dependent and raw ADC readings are not perfectly linear.

```
0–25 V voltage-divider sensor → S/OUT → ESP32 GPIO 34
                                 | 
                          0.1 µF capacitor → GND
```

## Voltage Calibration

### Current one-point calibration (already tested)

| Source                    | Value            |
|---------------------------|------------------|
| Multimeter                | 12.03 V          |
| ESP32 sensor after calibration | 12.04 V     |
| Difference                | +0.01 V          |
| Selected calibration multiplier | 4.96        |

```cpp
const float CAL_SLOPE = 4.96;
const float CAL_OFFSET = 0.0;
```

### Two-point calibration (recommended for full-range accuracy)

1. Measure a stable lower-voltage point, ideally around **11.6 – 12.0 V**.
   - Record: multimeter battery-terminal voltage and filtered ESP32 sensor reading.
2. Measure a stable higher-voltage point, ideally around **12.4 – 12.6 V**.
3. Compute:

```
CAL_SLOPE  = (V_mm_high - V_mm_low) / (V_sensor_high - V_sensor_low)
CAL_OFFSET = V_mm_low - (CAL_SLOPE × V_sensor_low)
```

4. Apply:

```
V_battery = (V_sensor × CAL_SLOPE) + CAL_OFFSET
```

Keep the actual hardware resistor/module values truthful. Apply calibration through `CAL_SLOPE` and `CAL_OFFSET`, **not** by changing resistor values in software.

---

## Stable SoC Strategy

### 1. Initial SoC (at startup)

- Start ADC, INA228, and temperature sensors.
- If the battery was continuously connected and a reliable saved energy state exists → restore it.
- If it was physically disconnected or replaced → use a stable rested-voltage estimate.
- Label voltage-only SoC as an estimate until INA228 energy tracking becomes valid.
- Do **not** initialize from a generic 3S table when a project-specific ZENOVA lookup table exists.

### 2. Coulomb / Energy Counting

Once INA228 data is available, update SoC from measured charge/discharge flow:

```
ΔAh = I × Δt_hours

SoC_new = SoC_old + ((Ah_charged - Ah_discharged) / 60 Ah) × 100
```

Or use energy directly:

```
E_remaining = 720 Wh + E_charged - E_discharged
SoC = 100 × (E_remaining / 720 Wh)
```

- Clamp the estimate to **0 – 100%**.
- Use measured input/output energy first.
- Add charge or inverter efficiency factors only after validating them with real system measurements.

### 3. Rested-Voltage Correction

Apply only a small correction toward the voltage-table estimate when **all** conditions are true:

- Battery current magnitude is very low.
- No meaningful solar charging is active.
- No meaningful appliance/inverter load is active.
- Voltage has been stable for roughly **10 – 30 minutes**.
- Battery temperature is Normal or Moderate.

**Do not** hard-reset SoC from voltage while charging, under load, or immediately after load/charger removal. Voltage relaxation can create a temporary rise/fall without a matching large energy change.

## Display Rules

Maintain **three distinct values**:

| Variable      | Meaning                                   | Update rule                                     |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| liveVoltage   | Actual calibrated battery terminal voltage | Updates continuously from ADC average           |
| estimatedSoC  | Internal energy-based SoC estimate        | Updated by INA228 current/energy flow           |
| displayedSoC  | User-facing percentage                    | Changes slowly and predictably                  |

Rules:

- During discharge, displayed SoC may remain unchanged or decrease gradually.
- During charging, displayed SoC may increase **only** when INA228 confirms charging current.
- Voltage rebound after a load stops must **not** make displayed SoC jump upward.
- Voltage sag during a heavy load must **not** create a large immediate SoC drop.
- Limit displayed percentage movement to about **1% every 30 – 60 seconds**.
- Allow voltage-table correction only after confirmed rest/stability.
- BMS cutoff, low-voltage protection, sensor failure, high temperature, or dangerous states override normal display behavior.
- The dashboard battery voltage display is clamped to the table range **9.000 – 12.600 V**. When the raw live voltage reads **≤ 10.65 V** (20% SoC / 80% DoD cutoff), the voltage text turns **red** to flag that the preferred DoD limit has been reached.

---

## Disconnect and Reconnect

### On disconnection

- Stop energy integration.
- Set active monitoring state to **Disconnected**.
- Mark active voltage/SoC unavailable according to dashboard/database design.
- Keep the previous SoC only as historical information.
- Do **not** continue reporting old SoC as a live state.

### On reconnection

1. Clear old ADC/filter samples.
2. Fill the averaging buffer with fresh ADC readings.
3. Wait about **2 – 5 seconds** for voltage stabilization.
4. Reinitialize voltage filters using the fresh voltage.
5. Confirm INA228/device communication.
6. Restore saved SoC **only** when the same battery stayed continuously connected.
7. Otherwise initialize a provisional voltage-based estimate after rest.
8. Resume energy tracking once valid INA228 readings are available.

Do **not** apply a universal 30-second SoC lock. Keep live voltage visible, label SoC as estimated while resolving state, and resume current/energy tracking as soon as valid measurements are available.

Provides 1% display steps from 100% to 0% for the 720 Wh bank.

> The voltage column is a **provisional rested-voltage estimate**. It is not a factory-verified ZENOVA curve and must be replaced by values from a controlled discharge test of the actual battery bank.

## Table Usage Rules

- Use this table only after the battery is resting with little/no load or charging.
- Call the result **"Voltage-Based SoC Estimate"** — do not call the voltage values factory verified or exact.
- Use the **INA228 energy count** as the primary long-term SoC source.
- Use live voltage mainly for monitoring, voltage safety, and connection detection.
- Use **20% SoC / 144 Wh / 80% DoD** as the preferred normal-use cutoff.
- Treat the **8.4 V** label boundary as an absolute low limit, not a daily operating target.

---

## Errors to Avoid

- Do not rely on raw voltage-only SoC during active charging or inverter use.
- Do not use a generic 3S voltage table as a confirmed ZENOVA curve.
- Do not use only a Kalman voltage filter and claim exact SoC.
- Do not freeze SoC permanently at the boot-time value.
- Do not allow SoC to rise merely because voltage rebounds; INA228 must confirm charging.
- Do not calculate ADC voltage from raw counts and a fixed 3.3 V assumption when calibration is available.
- Do not use 14.6 V LiFePO4 thresholds for a battery labeled with a 12.6 V charge limit.
- Do not rely on cloud/software alarms as the only safety layer.

## Hardware Safety Requirements

Battery BMS, correct **12.6 V Li-ion charger**, suitable fuses, properly rated wiring, and a DC-rated disconnect/protection device remain essential.
