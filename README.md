# AdlaWatt

An IoT-based transportable off-grid solar energy harvesting system with a mobile application for real-time energy monitoring, appliance recommendations, notifications, and backup power management during electricity interruptions.

AdlaWatt is designed to provide households with an alternative backup power source by harvesting solar energy, storing it in a battery, and supplying electricity through a built-in AC outlet. The mobile application allows users to monitor battery status, solar energy, power consumption, temperature, system status, energy history, and appliance recommendations.

> **Project Status:** In Development
> The mobile application is integrated with Supabase — authentication, database, and real-time streaming — for live monitoring, notifications, activity logs, appliances, and analytics report export. Some modules remain in progress: analytics chart rendering, the battery-aware recommendation engine, and the end-to-end ESP32 hardware feed.

## Overview

AdlaWatt is an IoT-based off-grid solar energy harvesting system developed as a backup power solution for households during electricity interruptions.

The system collects solar energy through a solar panel and stores the generated energy in a 12V battery housed inside a transportable lockable enclosure. A built-in AC outlet allows compatible household appliances to use the stored energy.

The system monitors energy generation, energy consumption, battery status, battery temperature, solar panel temperature, and interior temperature. Sensor data is transmitted through an ESP32 to a cloud database and streamed in real time to the AdlaWatt mobile application.

One of the main features of AdlaWatt is its appliance recommendation system. Users can identify appliances they plan to use, and the application recommends suitable appliances based on their power requirements and the available battery level.

AdlaWatt is intended as a backup power source during electricity interruptions and is not designed to replace the electrical grid.

---

## Features

### Real-Time Monitoring

The application displays live monitoring information received in real time from Supabase (the ESP32 writes to the `monitoring` table; the app subscribes to `postgres_changes` updates). The dashboard shows:

- Battery percentage and battery status (Charging / Discharging / Idle)
- Battery voltage
- Battery energy in watt-hours and estimated time remaining
- Current appliance load
- Depth of discharge (DoD) status (Safe / Unsafe)
- Incoming solar energy and solar status (Low / Moderate / High)
- Solar voltage, solar current, solar timer, and total energy
- Battery temperature, solar panel temperature, and interior temperature (each with Nominal / Elevated / High / Critical status)
- Device status (Online / Offline)
- Live weather (temperature, description, location) from OpenWeatherMap

A battery gauge with smooth animated transitions and a live weather card are rendered on the dashboard.

### Appliance Recommendation

The application allows users to view or select household appliances and receive recommendations based on the available battery state.

Recommendations are currently derived from appliance power ratings using a fixed wattage threshold (appliances above the threshold are marked *Not Advisable*). A battery-aware recommendation engine that factors in remaining battery capacity, runtime, and depth of discharge is planned as a future enhancement.

### Dashboard

The dashboard provides a summary of the current AdlaWatt system condition, including:

- Battery status and battery gauge
- Solar input
- Current load
- Device status
- Battery, solar panel, and interior temperatures
- Depth of discharge status
- Appliance recommendations
- Recent activity logs
- Quick navigation buttons with smooth scrolling

### Weather

The dashboard includes a live weather card that displays the current temperature, condition description, and location using the OpenWeatherMap API. Location is resolved through device permissions (`expo-location`) with balanced accuracy, and weather refreshes automatically.

### Notifications

The application generates and displays system notifications in real time:

- Battery alerts (charging, discharging, low level, fully charged, runtime, voltage)
- Temperature alerts (battery, solar panel, and interior — Nominal to Critical)
- Solar alerts (input detected, increased, unavailable, low input during charging)
- Load alerts (current load detected, no load, high load, consumption increased)
- Depth of discharge alerts (safe, unsafe, returned to safe)
- Device status alerts (online, offline, status changed)
- Data health alerts (stale monitoring, missing records, invalid time remaining)

Notifications are stored in the Supabase `notifications` table, include `normal` or `alert` types, use cooldowns to avoid alert spam, and can be marked as read. An unread-count badge is shown on the navigation bar.

### Activity Logs

The application provides an activity log for viewing recorded system activities and events. Logs are paginated and typed (info, warning, error, critical). The dashboard also provides a preview of recent activity logs with an option to view all recorded activities.

### Appliance Management

Users can view household appliances and their power requirements, select appliances for use, and manage custom appliances:

- Add, edit, and delete custom appliances
- Advisable / Not Advisable toggle per appliance
- Filters by advisability, power rating (All / Highest / Moderate / Low), and area (All Areas / Indoor / Outdoor / Custom Appliances)

### Component Monitoring

The Components screen provides live status information for the IoT and power components used by the AdlaWatt system, retrieved from Supabase with real-time updates.

### Analytics & Reports

The Analytics screen loads historical data from the `monitoring_history` and `appliance_usage_history` tables for a selected date range and frequency (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly). It generates:

- **PDF reports** (jsPDF + jspdf-autotable) with brand header, embedded AdlaWatt logo, summary statistics, energy summary, monitoring history, appliance usage history, and chart data tables
- **CSV exports** for raw data

Reports can be downloaded on web and shared through the native share sheet. Chart visuals are temporarily placeholder pending the implementation of the analytics chart module.

### Settings (Menu)

The Menu screen provides account management and user preferences:

- Edit username and email
- Change password (with current-password verification)
- Dark mode toggle, color-blind mode, font size, font weight, font family, language, vibration, and email-notification preferences
- Logout with confirmation

> Preference values are currently kept in application state and are not yet persisted across app restarts.

### About Us

The About Us section provides information about the AdlaWatt project and its developers.

### Authentication

The application uses Supabase authentication with:

- Registration (username, email, password) with validation and Terms and Conditions
- Login by username or email
- Persistent login sessions (AsyncStorage on native, localStorage on web)
- User profile loading and account updates (username, email, password)
- Email change handling with confirmation
- Logout functionality

## Data and Backend

### Current Integration State

The application is connected to Supabase for authentication, storage, and real-time streaming. Data is scoped to the authenticated user through `user_id` filtering and Supabase Realtime channels.

Static/mock dashboard values have been replaced by live Supabase queries and real-time subscriptions.

### Supabase Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `users` | User profiles (created by a database trigger on sign-up) |
| `monitoring` | Current live sensor readings (single row per user) |
| `monitoring_history` | Historical monitoring records for analytics |
| `appliance_usage_history` | Historical appliance usage for analytics |
| `appliances` | Household appliance catalog and selection state |
| `notifications` | Generated notifications with read state |
| `activity_logs` | Recorded system activities and events |
| `components` | IoT/power component list and live status |

### Real-Time Features

- **Monitoring**: `postgres_changes` subscription on the `monitoring` table (all events) for the current user
- **Device status**: `UPDATE` subscription dedicated to the device online/offline state
- **Notifications**: automatic alert generation driven by real-time monitoring updates, staleness checks, and auth state changes
- **Components**: live `componentsChannel` and `monitoringChannel` subscriptions

### Environment Variables

The app reads its configuration from local environment files (`.env.local`, gitignored). Required variables:

```text
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=<supabase project url>
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_KEY=<supabase anon/publishable key>
EXPO_PUBLIC_OWM_KEY=<openweathermap api key>
```

### Placeholder Modules

The following modules remain placeholders and are not yet end-to-end:

- **Analytics chart visuals** — data pipeline and CSV/PDF export are implemented; chart rendering is disabled
- **Recommendation service** (`src/services/recommendation.ts`) — currently a stub; advisability logic lives inline using a fixed wattage threshold
- **Notification safety thresholds** — load/voltage alert rules are inactive until the production thresholds are configured
- **Forgot password** — the route constant exists but the screen is not yet implemented

---

## Data Flow

The intended data flow is:

```text

## Limitations

The current prototype has several limitations.

### Prototype Limitation

The project is currently a prototype and is not intended for commercial production or large-scale deployment.

### Backup Power Only

AdlaWatt is designed as an alternative power source during electricity interruptions. It is not intended to replace the electrical grid.

### Solar Dependence

Energy harvesting depends on available sunlight.

### Compatible Appliances

The system is intended for compatible household appliances within the supported power capacity.

### Internet Connectivity

Real-time mobile monitoring requires network connectivity between the IoT system, cloud services, and mobile application.

### ESP32 / Hardware Integration

The ESP32 hardware feed is being integrated. The application consumes data through Supabase, but the end-to-end hardware → cloud → app loop is not yet fully verified.

### Placeholder Modules

- Analytics chart visuals are temporarily disabled (data and exports are implemented)
- The recommendation engine uses a fixed wattage threshold instead of battery-aware logic
- Notification safety rules for load and voltage are inactive until production thresholds are configured
- The forgot password screen is not yet implemented

### Settings Persistence

Menu preferences (dark mode, font settings, toggles) are maintained in application state only and reset when the app restarts.

### Dark Mode Coverage

Dark/light design tokens and the dark-mode toggle exist, but screen-level dark styling is applied inconsistently across some screens.

### Development Leftovers

The repository contains a leftover development screen (`test-con`) and a few unused dependencies (e.g., `openmeteo`, `@react-navigation/*`) that are candidates for cleanup.

## Research Evaluation

The AdlaWatt study uses the **System Usability Scale (SUS)** to evaluate the usability of the mobile application.

The evaluation focuses on users' assessment of:

- Real-time monitoring
- Appliance recommendation
- Overall user experience
- Mobile application usability

The SUS consists of 10 evaluation items and is interpreted using a Likert scale.

The SUS calculation follows:

```text
SUS Score = (Sum of Score Contributions) × 2.5
```

The capstone identifies SUS as the evaluation tool for assessing the usability of the developed mobile application.

## Research Purpose

AdlaWatt was developed to address the need for a practical and affordable backup power solution during electricity interruptions.

The research identifies a gap in existing systems that commonly provide energy monitoring but do not combine portable off-grid solar harvesting, real-time battery monitoring, temperature monitoring, appliance recommendations, and mobile application monitoring in one system.

The project therefore combines these features into a single system intended to help households monitor and manage available backup energy more safely and efficiently.
